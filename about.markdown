<p>
    I grew up in a rural Australian town called Mildura, which is about 550km
    North-West of Melbourne, on the banks of the Murray river. <br>
    I moved to Melbourne to study for University; I attended the University of
    Melbourne and was awarded a Bachelor of Science degree, majoring in Computing
    and Software Systems, in 2017.
</p>
<p>
    Since then I've worked in various capacities predominantly in the financial
    services sector; I've worked for multiple tier-1 Australian banks as a
    software engineer (developing integrations using MuleSoft as well as teaching
    a team to do the same), project planner, solution designer/architect, and
    now delivery manager.
</p>
<p>
    I find many things fascinating and am generally interested in all sorts of
    creative hobbies which involve making things. I've tried lots of things and want to try many, many more.
    <br>I intend to catalogue my results here, partly for my recollection and
    partly for the general interest of others.
